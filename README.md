# Pharma-Sales-Profitability-Analytics
## Executive Revenue & Profitability Analytics | Power BI

# Executive Summary

This project was developed as part of the DataDNA Pharma Challenge and focuses on transforming transactional pharmaceutical sales data into strategic commercial intelligence.

The objective was not simply to visualize performance, but to identify revenue concentration risk, margin drivers, regional variance, and structural profitability levers to support executive-level decision-making.

The solution was designed using a KPI-led framework aligned with how commercial leadership evaluates performance.

# Business Context
- Pharmaceutical retail performance is influenced by:
- Geographic demand concentration
- Pharmacy type distribution
- Product portfolio mix
- Promotion impact
- Margin compression across categories

# The core question addressed:

Where is value being created, where is it leaking, and how can leadership reallocate focus to maximize sustainable profitability?

# Analytical Approach

The dashboard was structured across three executive layers:

## Revenue & Contribution Analysis
- % Contribution by country and region
- Revenue concentration assessment
- Identification of high-dependency markets

## Profitability & Margin Diagnostics
- COGS derivation and gross margin calculation
- Margin variance vs regional average
- High-volume vs high-margin portfolio trade-offs

## Operational & Structural Insights
- Performance comparison across pharmacy types
- Promotion impact on profitability
- Regional performance dispersion analysis

Advanced DAX measures were used to ensure dynamic benchmarking and contextual comparisons.

# Strategic Insights
- Revenue is disproportionately concentrated in a small number of markets, creating exposure risk.
- Margin performance varies materially within the same region, suggesting operational execution gaps.
- Urban pharmacies drive scale, but profitability is driven primarily by product mix discipline.
- Promotional strategies increase volume but dilute margin — indicating need for precision targeting.
- Certain lower-volume categories materially outperform in margin contribution, highlighting portfolio optimization opportunities.

# Executive Recommendations
- Replicate operational playbooks from top-performing regions.
- Rebalance product mix toward structurally higher-margin categories.
- Implement margin-protected promotional frameworks.
- Use contribution-based prioritization for capital allocation.
- Monitor variance vs regional benchmarks to identify underperformance early.
